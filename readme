when use the command "make" to build the shared library, to make the shared library successfully builds
please input a line into the shell "export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:.", and then use the command "make"
when we place this line into the makefile, there is always some errors when we use the libmem.so. 
that's it, thank you!
